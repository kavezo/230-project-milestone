#Milestone code - singing synthesis with WaveNet

As stated in the writeup, I trained my two baseline models on an unmodified clone of tensorflow-wavenet, along with a slightly modified clone of wavenet-vocoder. I still included the tensorflow-wavenet code, and also included the wavenet-vocoder code with the module I added and explanations of the modifications done.

Trained models can be found in the models directory, and predictions in the output directory. I also included the recording that the conditional model attempted to predict.
